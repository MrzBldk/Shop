Make sure you have installed and configured docker and node.js in your environment. After that, you can run the below commands from the base directory
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
cd web/react-spa
npm start
```
It is also possible to set docker-compose and react-spa as startup projects in Visual Studio and build and run the application with F5 or Ctrl+F5.
